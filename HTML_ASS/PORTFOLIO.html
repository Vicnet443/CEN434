            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I’m an aspiring network engineer and cybersecurity enthusiast currently in my fourth year studying Computer Engineering. I’m curious by nature and driven by a single goal: to build practical technology that makes communication safer and more reliable.</p>
            <p>Outside of tech I’m a musician at heart — I sing and play piano, drums, and saxophone — and I love playing football. Those activities keep my creativity, teamwork, and discipline sharp, and they remind me how much energy and focus real projects need.</p>
            <p>I’m a people-person: I enjoy helping and advising others, and I actively evangelize and preach the word of God. I don’t like doing things the same way everyone else does — I look for better approaches and try to bring fresh thinking to every problem.</p>
            <h3>What I offer </h3>
            <ul>
                 <li>Solid foundation in networking and cybersecurity fundamentals (theory + hands-on learning).</li>
            <li>Strong communication and mentoring skills — I enjoy teaching and advising peers.</li>
            <li>Creative problem solving and a willingness to challenge the status quo.</li>
            </ul>
           
            
            <h3>What I’m building toward </h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Creating technologies that improve the telecommunications field.</li>
            <li>Enhancing the security of people’s personal data.</li>
            <li>Designing a system to track and manage all of a user’s devices securely and responsibly.</li>
            </ol>
